UNDER DEVELOPMENT

A stratum pool built on the MERN stack designed for coin foundations to connect with their users and drive development fund revenue.


Requirements

* coin daemon for primay and auxillery coins (preferably one with a relatively updated API and not some crapcoin :p)


Installation and Configuration
-------------

#### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/pigeoncoin/pigeonpool
cd pigeonpool
npm install
```

#### Configuration

Create a .env file in the root directory.  You will need to specify the specific environment variables here.  Use .env.example as an example
